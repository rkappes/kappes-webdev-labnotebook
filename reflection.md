### HTML

1. For the most part I was able to complete the exercises on my own. Referencing the code samples was helpful. I did have more trouble with the form exercise and so watched the video for help on that one.

1. I thought all the exercises were helpful. When learning/watching about them in class it seems easy/straightforward enough, but definitely helps to actually write the code yourself vs relying on just watching.

1. Everything seemed to be explained pretty well.

1. None that I can think of.

### Accessibility

1. Yes I was able to complete this exercise on my own as it was very similiar to the form exercise from the previous week.
2. The exercise was definitely helpful in re-affirming how to go about constructing a proper form.
3. Slight confusion on how to handle the 'create' button (as it's similiar in functionality to the submit input type, but 'create' isn't a designated action).
4. None that I can think of

### CSS

1. I found the videos very helpful this time.
2. Exercise 6, with the media queries was cool to learn about
3. Maybe I missed this in the readings/lecture, but the Exercise 6 was the first time I'd heard of that concept.
4. Layout and Position exericises were definitely the hardest for me.

### Flexbox, Grid, and Bootstrap

1. Again, I found the videos very helpful - specially for the 03-grid and modal exercise.
2. I found all of these exercises helpful - I think the bootstrap grid exercises were good in order to see the difference between using normal grid and bootstrap grid.
3. Everything was explained pretty well - just a lot of new information to take in!
4. An exercise that applies either the flexbox or grid to something other than boxes would be helpful - ie something that have more content within the container.

### Javascript Week 6

1. The exercises went pretty well, felt pretty straight forward. There were some minor things that I had to look at the videos to fix.
2. I found these helpful, they seemed trivial but Javascript is different enough from other coding languages that it was good to do these.
3. I think everything was explained pretty well
4. None that I can think of!

### Javascript Week 7

1. I definitely had a lot more trouble with theses exercises than last week's. The videos were very helpful
2. The fetch exercise was really good to better understand how promises worked.
3. I found the reduce function a bit more complicated to understand.
4. None that I can think og!
