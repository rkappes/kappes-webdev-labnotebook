1. For the most part I was able to complete the exercises on my own. Referencing the code samples was helpful. I did have more trouble with the form exercise and so watched the video for help on that one.

1. I thought all the exercises were helpful. When learning/watching about them in class it seems easy/straightforward enough, but definitely helps to actually write the code yourself vs relying on just watching.

1. Everything seemed to be explained pretty well.

1. None that I can think of.

### Accessibility

1. Yes I was able to complete this exercise on my own as it was very similiar to the form exercise from the previous week.
2. The exercise was definitely helpful in re-affirming how to go about constructing a proper form.
3. Slight confusion on how to handle the 'create' button (as it's similiar in functionality to the submit input type, but 'create' isn't a designated action).
4. None that I can think of

### CSS

1. I found the videos very helpful this time.
2. Exercise 6, with the media queries was cool to learn about
3. Maybe I missed this in the readings/lecture, but the Exercise 6 was the first time I'd heard of that concept.
4. Layout and Position exericises were definitely the hardest for me.
