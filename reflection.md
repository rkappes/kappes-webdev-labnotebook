1. For the most part I was able to complete the exercises on my own. Referencing the code samples was helpful. I did have more trouble with the form exercise and so watched the video for help on that one.

1. I thought all the exercises were helpful. When learning/watching about them in class it seems easy/straightforward enough, but definitely helps to actually write the code yourself vs relying on just watching.

1. Everything seemed to be explained pretty well.

1. None that I can think of.
